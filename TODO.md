## üêõ Known Bugs & Issues

### Current Issues
- [ ] Rocket self-damage may not be working (needs testing)
- [ ] Guard AI not fully implemented (need pathfinding)
- [ ] Capture zones not rendered on client
- [ ] Base upgrade UI missing on client
- [ ] Ammo crates not visible on client

### Performance
- [ ] Too many particles can cause lag (limit particle count)
- [ ] Collision detection expensive with many blocks (use spatial grid)
- [ ] Network traffic could be optimized (delta compression)

## üí° Design Notes

### Spy vs Spy Inspiration
The game should feel like strategic sabotage with:
- **Information warfare** - Radar gives advantage, destroying it blinds enemies
- **Trap warfare** - Set traps in enemy territory, avoid theirs
- **Resource denial** - Destroy enemy buildings to prevent their upgrades
- **Hit and run** - Quick strikes on bases then retreat

### Balance Considerations
- Hammer destroys too fast ‚Üí increase block HP?
- Repair too cheap ‚Üí increase scrap cost?
- Buildings too easy to level ‚Üí captured base protection working?
- Scrap economy ‚Üí ensure destroying is worth the risk

### Map Size & Scale
- **Map:** 5000 x 5000px
- **Terrain tiles:** 50px (perfect size confirmed)
- **Building blocks:** 20px (good for detailed destruction)
- **Buildings:** 250-500px (new larger size)
- **Capture zones:** 150px radius

## üìä Priority Matrix

**Implement Next:**
1. Health bars on blocks (visual feedback)
2. Radar parts & construction system (core gameplay loop)
3. Minimap when radar built (reward for crafting)
